<h3>A About us</h3>

<p><big>My mission for this site will be to enrich everyone with the knowledge and motivation of soccer by providing you an interface with multiple options to use from and remain informed on the most recent changes done in and outside the pitch. <strong>*Gathering the newest and not so new products for you to buy.</strong> I am committed to enhancing the experience of soccer by posting recent leader boards about the top competitions in the world giving also visual representations of such tables and or ladders, <strong>*I will also have information about specific players.</strong> I hope you enjoy our site and keep coming back for updates. The signature ball page was built for informational and educational use for the most beautiful game called soccer</big></p>
<p><big>I have decided to built a site dedicated to the sport of soccer, because I like many others found that we like to be informed about a particular sport and it just so happens that my favirote sport is soccer. I am a student currently learning web design, that is why the beginning stages for this site will look like a kindergarden kid's drawing but trust me I will improve my range of skill and with it the site will look much more proffessionaly made.</big></a><br>   
<p><big>Soccer is a social sport like many others, some may love it others will hate it but at the end of the day both parties get to interact with each other. This site will bring about new ways to see and play the sport of soccer. If you wish to cantact me please see the bottom of the page for a quick link to "me".</big></p>
