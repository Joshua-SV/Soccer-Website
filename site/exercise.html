<div><dt><h3>Push-Ups</h3></dt>

 <dd>A classic exercise in which a person lies facing the floor and, while keeping their back straight, raises their body by pressing down on their hands.</dd>

 <dd>Other methods of push-ups exist, and I will give you a handful so be ready to sweat.</dd>
</div>
<dt>Wide-grip pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: chest.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, start from a normal pushup position but spread your hands wider than shoulder length. This will force your chest to pick up the brunt of the work from your triceps and shoulders.</dd><br>

<dt>Narrow-grip pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: triceps.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, Do a normal pushup with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath your chest.</dd><br>

<dt>single-leg pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: intensifies work on upper body and core.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, start as a normal pushup, then Lift one leg up off the ground and do a set. Switch legs on the next set.</dd><br>

<dt>Feet-elevated pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: intensifies work on upper body and core.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, Do a normal pushup, but with your feet elevated on a stable platform like a box or bench. The higher the platform, the more you'll work your shoulders, chest, core, and scapular stabilizers (the muscles that connect your neck, midback, and shoulders).</dd><br>

<dt>One-arm pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: arms and chest.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, Keeping your feet in a wider than a normal pushup position, use just one arm to do a pushup. Keep your elbow close to your body.</dd><br>

<dt>Clap pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: chest.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, do normal push-ups, but at the peak of your pushup, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap pushups will help you develop explosive power while also bulking up your pecs for a superhero chest.</dd><br>

<dt>Spiderman pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: core</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, Do a normal pushup but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise (like Spiderman climbing a wall). Switch knees with each rep.</dd><br>

<dt>Pike pushups</dt><br>

 <dd>Target area: shoulders.</dd><br>

 <dd>To begin, start From the normal pushup position, lift your hips as high as they can go while keeping your legs and back straight with the top of your head pointing downward (you want to make a triangle shape out of your body). Push your body up and down, activating your shoulders.</dd><br>

<div><dt><h3>Squats</h3></dt>

  <dd>The movement begins from a standing position. Weights are often used, either in the hand or as a bar braced across the trapezius muscle or rear deltoid muscle in the upper back. The movement is initiated by moving the hips back and bending the knees and hips to lower the torso and accompanying weight, then returning to the upright position.</dd>

  <dd>Other methods of Squats exist, and I will give you a handful so be ready to sweat.</dd><br>
</div>
<dt>Back squat </dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: barbell</dd><br>

  <dd>The bar is held on the back of the body at the base of the neck or lower across the upper back. In powerlifting the barbell is often held in a lower position in order to create a lever advantage, while in weightlifting it is often held in a higher position which produces a posture closer to that of the clean and jerk. These variations are called low bar and high bar, respectively.</dd><br>

<dt>Front squat</dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: barbell</dd><br>

  <dd>The weight (usually a barbell) is held in front of the body across the clavicles and deltoids in either a clean grip, as is used in weightlifting, or with the arms crossed and hands placed on top of the barbell.</dd><br>

<dt>Overhead squat</dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: barbell</dd><br>

  <dd>The barbell is held overhead in a wide-arm snatch grip; however, it is also possible to use a closer grip if balance allows.</dd><br>

<dt>Zercher squat</dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: barbell</dd><br>

  <dd>The barbell is held in the crooks of the arms, on the inside of the elbow. One method of performing this is to deadlift the barbell, hold it against the thighs, squat into the lower portion of the squat, and then hold the bar on the thighs as you position the crook of your arm under the bar and then stand up. This sequence is reversed once the desired number of repetitions has been performed.</dd><br>

<dt>Belt squat</dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: dip belt</dd><br>

  <dd>Is an exercise performed the same as other squat variations except the weight is attached to a hip belt i.e. a dip belt</dd><br>

<dt>Bodyweight squat</dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: none</dd><br>

  <dd>done with no weight or barbell, often at higher repetitions than other variants.</dd><br>

<dt>Jump squat</dt><br>

  <dd>Equiment: none</dd><br>

  <dd>A plyometrics exercise where the squatter engages in a rapid eccentric contraction and jumps forcefully off the floor at the top of the range of motion.</dd><br>

<div><dt><h3>Lunges</h3></dt>

   <dd>Equiment: none</dd><br>

   <dd>not only does a set of lunges strengthen your legs and shape your backside, this single exercise works the hips, quads, hamstrings, glutes, and abs all at once. When done properly, lunges will challenge your stability and improve your posture. </dd><br>

   <dd>Stand with your feet shoulder's width apart, spine long and straight, shoulders back, gaze forward. Step forward with one leg into a wide stance (about one leg's distance between feet) while maintaining spine alignment. Lower your hips until both knees are bent at approximately a 90 degree angle. Your front knee should not extend over your ankle, and your back knee should hover above the ground. Keep your weight in your heels as you push back up to starting position. Repeat on both sides.
</div>
</dd><br>

<div><dt><h3>Curls</h3></dt>

<dd>Here are 5 different ways to do a bicep curl. Incorporate these into your arm workouts; do not be surprised if you feel a new type of soreness the next day.</dd><br>
</div>
<dd></dd><br>

<dt>Concentration Curls</dt><br>

<dd>Equiment: dumbbells</dd><br>

<dd>while sitting on a bench with your feet firmly on the floor, place the back of your left upper arm on the inside of your thigh. Keep your arm on your thigh throughout. Put your right hand on the right knee for stability. Do your curls on the left side, then repeat on the right side. 

</dd><br>

<dt>Hammer Curls</dt><br>

<dd>Equiment: dumbbells</dd><br>

<dd>Hammer curls are a great way to strengthen your biceps and forearms while targeting the “outer head” of the biceps. As you lower your arms, the dumbbell and wrist look like a hammer, thus the name. (The more you know, right?) Hold a set of dumbbells with a neutral grip so your palms are facing each other. Curl the dumbbells while keeping your palms facing each other.</dd><br>

<dt>Zottman Curl</dt><br>

<dd>Equiment: dumbbells</dd><br>

<dd>Stand with a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing forward. Curl the weights as you turn your wrists so that your palms face away at the top. Reverse the movement, returning to the starting position with your palms facing forward</dd><br>
